ls -a -usefull command to show all files and directiories (including the hidden ones)

grep -command which enables to show files/directiories containing letter or letters in files/directories names we want to display, e.g. ls -a | grep D 

"|" - pipe (polish: "potok") - allows you to use at least two commands in one command, it allows you to list the data quickly among a directory containing a large amount of others files/directiories

">" - Greater Than Sign - it allows to overwrite file/directory (if file/directory already exists - ">" overwrite, if there is no one such file/directory - ">" create new).

ls -a | grep D > ListaPlikowZLiterkaD.txt - this command creates new file with list of files/directiories cointaining in name letter "D". Below I have presented the result below:
	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja ~ % cat ListaPlikowZLiterkaD.txt
 	.DS_Store
 	Desktop
 	Documents
 	Downloads
 	ListaPlikowZLiterkaD.txt

inne:
	find / -maxdepth 2 > nazwapliku.txt - only stdout in file nazwapliku.txt
	find / -maxdepth 2 > nazwapliku.txt 2>&1 - stdout and stderr in file nazwapliku.txt
	find / -maxdepth 2 2> nazwapliku.txt - only errors in file nazwapliku.txt

1. ps command display list of active processes
- ps: displays information about a selection of the active processes opened form bash;
  PID - Process ID, TTY - TeleTYpe (e.g. pts/0) 
  using ctr+alt+F1 I can transfer form graphic mode to text mode, 
  using alt+(form F1 to F6) I can switch shells e.g. TTY1, TTY2, TTY6 - more than one person can work on one c  computer from different place
  if I use alt+F7 it renturn to graphic mode
  TIME
  CMD - command
- ps a: to see every process on system not only mine, it shows all processes which have its own TTY
- ps -a: Select all processes except both session leaders and processes not associated with a terminal (it removes shell form list) 
- ps x: to see every process on system without TTY
- ps aux: to see every process on the system using BSD syntax (e.g. root's and mine)
ps -aux is distinct from ps aux!!!
- ps -aux print all processes owned by a user named x, as well as printing all processes that would be selected by the -a option. If the user named x does not exist, this ps may interpret the command as ps aux instead and print a warning.

- ps auxf - shows tree of processes (parent and child)

- sign "?" in TTY column means that program is not assigned to any TTY (those are usually "demons" - programs which are working in backgroud).

- all bash processes: ps aux | grep bash
- all root processes: ps aux | grep root


2. PID - process identificator - user can use PID to perform operations e.g. kill
kill - enables to stop process, to use kill command: kill PID (it send a signal to a process)

I used ps to show actual processes, gedit PID was 936, I tried to kill 936, but gedit was unresponsive - I tried with SIGKILL: kill -9 936  - I shut down gedit.

killall (name of process)
killall shell - no process found
I opened three windows of mozilla firefox,
killall firefox - closed all windows.

There is one important thing.
If I open process by terminal and then I use ctrl+Z I can't kill this process, I have to use kill -9 (PID).

kill doesn't work for any process, e.g. doesnt work on root processes, because I am not root


3. ctrl+C - closes active program in terminal 
e.g.
	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja repos % cat
 	^C
I opened new text program and I closed this process.

ctrl+D - told the shell that you weren't going to type any more commands, so it exited; then the terminal exited because its subprogram had terminated.
It doesn't send the end signal, it just closes the input stream

	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja repos % cat > wynik1.txt
 	witaj^C
 	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja repos % cat wynik1.txt
 	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja repos %"

	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja repos % cat >wynik2.txt
 	witaj%                                                                          
	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja repos % cat wynik2.txt
 	witaj% (double ctrl+D)                                                          
	ala@MacBook-Pro-Alicja repos %"

ctrl+D - enables safe ending of process with saving changes


4. ctrl + Z - stop the program (but the cursor must be active in terminal),
the program is in memory, but doesn't run, it is in background.

jobs - shows running programs in the background

bg - to run stopped process in background - but the stopped job will remain still in the background (we can use bg %1)

fg - to move job on first plan, we can now close the job/program (fg %1)

programname & - enables to run the program in background, I can use console and programm, without & I can't use console, I have to use (ctrl+Z for e. g.)

tar - enables extract or create archive:

tar -xvf /path/to/foo.tar - to extract
e.g.
tar -xvf Desktop/Pictures.tar existingfilr/directory

tar -cvf /path/to/foo.tar /path/to/foo/ - to create
e.g.
tar -cvf Desktop/Pictures.tar existingfile/directory

wget - enables to dowmload file or site form web, enables to save on disk
e.g.
wget website_name
wget https://google.com
