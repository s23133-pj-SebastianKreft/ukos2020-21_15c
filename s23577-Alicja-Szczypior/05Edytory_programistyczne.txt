1.
I leant a little bit about Linux and its licenses: BSD, Apache, GNU/GPL, LGPL.

2.
I learnt how to use vim on previous lessons.
We have also: nano, vi and mcedit which we can open from console.
The others that opens in window: geany, gedit, jedit, atom.io, sublime text

3.
Text editors are different. For examle they have an option to line out a specific expression to facilitate work with text.

nano:
enter - text is moving one line down
space - first line is moving right
backspace - first line is movig left (it depends in what line is cursor)
left bracket - line is going to be a note

vi:
enter - nothing happens
space - nothing happens
left bracket - is moving cursot to the beginning
right bracket - is moving cursor to the end
i - enables to edit text

mcedit:
colours of library - red, name of variables - yellow
enter - text is moving one line down
space - first line is moving rite
backspace - first line is moving down (it depends in what line is cursor)

geany:
the same like mcedit, but:
when I am typing only first letters of command: e.g. pr and I am pressing ctr+space then geany is helping me with command and suggest: printf

jedit:
the same like mcedit, but different colours

3. diff command enables to see what are the differences in files
how to type?
diff name_of_file1 name_of_file2

and:
diff -y name_file1 name_file2
it shows all lines of file 1 and 2, line by line:
text line 1 file 1
	text line 1 file 2
text line 2 file 1
	text line 2 file 2 etc.
